## SV-UVM based Verification EnvironmentDevelopment for YAPP Router

This project aims at developing a verification environment for a router design. The design under test (DUT) is called yapp router. The packet router accepts data packets on a single input port, in_data, and routes the packets to one of three output channels: channel 0, channel 1 or channel 2. The input and output ports have slightly different signal protocols. The router also has a host interface for programming registers.
